### Submitting Task 2, the document (parts A, B, and D)

1. Use the [Task 2 template](https://westerngovernorsuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/jim_ashe_wgu_edu/ESLuMNRuDjpCrKvqWaC6cywB4I97WEPdk5MRZRq4LfmFhQ)
2. Check Grammar!! See below.

### Submitting Task 2

## Grammar

:::{warning}
Grammar and sources are the *most common* reason for returned submissions! Even minor grammatical errors can prevent a submission from passing.
:::

After focusing on the content, check your grammar using [Grammarly.com](https://www.grammarly.com/) ![grmmarly](https://github.com/ashejim/C769/blob/main/url_images/icon-grammarly.png?raw=true#icon) (it's what the evaluators use). Style is not assessed (blue and green), but even a few grammar mistakes will prevent competency in *Professional Communication*. The free side has been sufficient, but if using the online app, you sometimes need to wait before mistakes are caught. 


:::{warning}
Students have reported missed mistakes when using the Google doc Grammarly extension. Therefore, we advise that you copy and paste it into the online app or purchase the premium version for MS Word.

- No references are required.
