# Task 2: The Documentation

Write your documentation following **C964 Task 2 documentation template**:
> [![Task 2 documentation template](https://github.com/ashejim/C964/blob/main/url_images/template_task2.png?raw=true#image-thumb)](https://westerngovernorsuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/jim_ashe_wgu_edu/ERGxhsNfkbhEutlkXVFITMQBPOmWlkVx1p5H0UisvnBesg?rtime=3q_Efs-u2kg)

:::{warning}
*Do not follow the official C964 rubric.* Instead, follow the guidelines found on this webpage and the above [Task 2 template](https://westerngovernorsuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/jim_ashe_wgu_edu/ERGxhsNfkbhEutlkXVFITMQBPOmWlkVx1p5H0UisvnBesg?rtime=3q_Efs-u2kg). This template has seemingly become the defacto rubric and is what evaluators expect.

To gauge the level of detail evaluators typically expect, review these examples.

:::{tip}
Sections are assessed independently against the rubric requirements, i.e., when evaluating a section, the evaluator will check for the fulfillment of the requirements within that section. They *don't* assess writing style. You can reuse content from other areas or C951 task 3 as needed. It's not about writing something fun to read -it's about demonstrating that the requirements are met. 

1. Follow the [Task 2 template](https://westerngovernorsuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/jim_ashe_wgu_edu/ERGxhsNfkbhEutlkXVFITMQBPOmWlkVx1p5H0UisvnBesg?rtime=3q_Efs-u2kg)
2. Submit parts A, B, and D as a *single* pdf file.
3. Part D is what matters -particularly the *Data Product Code*, *Accuracy Analysis*, and *User Guide* sections. Parts A and B need to be completed but have few qualitative requirements.

## Sources and Grammar

:::{warning}
Grammar and sources are the *most common* reason for returned submissions! However, even minor grammatical errors can prevent a submission from passing.
:::

After focusing on the content, check your grammar using [Grammarly.com](https://www.grammarly.com/)![](c:/Users/Jim/Downloads/grammarly.png=25x25) 📝 (it's what the evaluators use). Style is not assessed (blue and green), but even a few grammar mistakes will prevent competency in *Professional Communication*. The free side has been sufficient, but if using the online app, you sometimes need to wait before mistakes are caught. 

For sources, you should follow [APA guidelines](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines). Avoid errors by using the [MS Word Reference Tool](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-bibliography-citations-and-references-17686589-4824-4940-9c69-342c289fa2a5) to create and manage references.

Students have reported missed mistakes when using the Google doc Grammarly extension. Therefore, we advise that you copy and paste it into the online app or purchase the premium version for MS Word.

## FAQ
**I've completed task 2. Should I send it to my course instructor for review?** 

If you have specific questions on concerns -yes. However, in most cases, it's best just to submit. What suffices as “sufficient detail” is highly subjective. We can always tell you to add more, but if you've done your best to fulfill the requirements, submit it and let them tell you which (if any) parts need to be rewritten. At best, it passes; at worst, we address the issues cited by the evaluator -and then it passes. Responding to the more narrow focus of the evaluator's comments is generally easier than overworking the entire project.

You have *unlimited* submissions but limited time. And, typically this is the best and most efficient approach. 

**The task 2 template has suggested page lengths. Are these lengths required?**

No. Those are just suggestions. The individual evaluator determines what qualifies as "sufficient detail" and will vary depending on the project and writing style. If you feel you've met the requirements, simply move on to the next section. Upon submission, it will pass, or they will request more details.

**How many submission attempts do I have?**
You have unlimited submissions (as with all WGU performance assessments). Furthermore, a project requiring multiple submissions is not precluded from being given an excellence award. However, do attempt to fully meet *each* requirement as submissions falling significantly short of the minimum requirements may be *locked* from further submissions without instructor approval. Moreover, such submissions do not receive meaningful evaluator comments.   

**I can't find sources for section B, *Other Works*. What can I do?**
You are likely overinterpreting what's required. Rarely are submissions sent back because cited works are unsuitable. You can use referenceable work created by a professional which can be *related* to your project -it does not need to align with your project entirely. For example, a cloud migration project might include articles about AWS, security advantages, cost advantages, etc. 

**My task two was returned for *sources* stating:**
> "In-text citations could not be found for portions of the task that have been quoted or paraphrased... "
**What does this comment mean?**

It indicates they could not find a matching in-text citation for every source on your reference list. Check that each reference has a match following APA style, e.g., (Author, year), and remove any references without matches. Use the [MS Word Reference Tool](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-bibliography-citations-and-references-17686589-4824-4940-9c69-342c289fa2a5) to create, manage references, and avoid such errors.
