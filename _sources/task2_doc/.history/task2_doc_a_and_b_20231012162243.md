# Task 2 parts A and B

The purpose of parts A and B is to demonstrate competency in communicating your technical solution to different less technical audiences. Follow the [Task 2 Template (new)](https://westerngovernorsuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/jim_ashe_wgu_edu/EWqB1zvgCDVMjsSivPMmFzYB4oUX-bj8Y5r4MjZt7f9xlQ?e=3F6xr2)

- Part A - Convince senior leadership to approve your project.
- Part B - Implementation plan for IT leadership (but not CS experts) or middle management.

Part D, explains the CS-related aspects of your project and (with the exception of the [User Guide](task2d:userguide)) should target the computer science subject matter experts. This is *not* a business project, and neither does the rubric have any qualitative business criteria for parts A and B. As such, parts A and B aspects such as budgets, methodology, and planning parts are not assessed rigorously from a business perspective.

## Part A: Letter of Transmittal

Write a letter convincing senior leadership to approve your project -a brief cover letter (suggested length 1-2 pages) describing the problem, how the application (part C) applies to the problem, the practical benefits to the organization, and a brief implementation plan. Include all artifacts typical of a professional (business) letter, e.g., subject line, date, greeting, signature, etc. **Write everything in the future tense.**

The letter should be concise and target a non-technical audience. Include the following:

- A summary of the problem.
- A proposed solution centering around your application.
- How the proposed solution benefits the organization.
- A summary of the costs, timeline, data, and any ethical concerns (if relevant).
- Your relevant expertise.

## Part B: Project Proposal

The project proposal should target your client’s IT leadership or middle management. This audience may be IT professionals but have limited computer science expertise. Use appropriate industry jargon and sufficient technical details to describe the proposed project and its application. Remember, you’re establishing the technical context for your project and how it will be implemented for the client. **Write everything in the future tense.**
