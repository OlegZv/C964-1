# Task 2 part D 
Part D of the documentation explains the technical details of your project and should target the computer science subject matter expert, i.e., the evaluators. Hence, of the documentation, part D is most valued and scrutinized by the evaluators. Of part D, the [Data Product Code](task2d:dataproduct), [Accuracy Analysis](task2d:accuracy), and [User [Guide](task2d:userguide) are the most important. As such, we recommend completing these sections first.

(task2d:userguide)=
## User Guide

The evaluator might go here first. Following your instructions, they will run your app, simultaneously verifying it runs as intended and gaining context of its purpose through demonstration. 

Include an enumerated (steps 1, 2, 3, etc.) guide to execute and use your application. The evaluator will play the "client" role and follow your instructions as provided. So make them "dummy" proof. You should include instructions for downloading and installing any necessary software or libraries (they'll have most of these installed anyways). Your application will be considered “user-friendly” if the evaluator successfully executes and uses your application on a Windows 10 machine following your instructions.

- **Provide examples.** Examples not only make the instructions easier to follow (hence easier to pass), but also demonstrate how the app solves the organizational need. When applicable provide sample input or input which can be copied and pasted. 

- **Test.** Create a new environment or borrow a friend's computer, follow your instructions verbatim, and verify that everything works as expected. It's easy to overlook small details.

:::{margin} No Windows machine?
*Nowhere is Windows specifically required* in the C964 rubric. However, WGU evaluators are only issued Windows 10 machines, and they may have difficulty running a Linux or Mac app without special instructions. Therefore, we recommend that the [user guide](task2_doc:userguide) provide explicit instructions for a Windows 10 user to run your code, such as using a [virtual machine](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-run-ubuntu-desktop-on-a-virtual-machine-using-virtualbox#1-overview), remote machine, or using a [Linux subsysem](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-10#1-overview). You should also provide a note when submitting to Assessments and alerting your course instructor. See the [Task 2 part C FAQ](task2c:faq:linux) for more details.

(task2d:dataproduct)=
## Data Product Code

This section should describe the development of your ML application justifying and explaining decisions made in the process. Explain the *what*, *how*, and *why* of the machine learning model and its application.

- *What?* Outline what your product does and then explain in detail what machine learning does in solving the proposed problem. Describe the algorithms, libraries, and other tools used to develop the machine learning model.

-*How?* Outline your applications implementation plan and then explain in detail how the machine learning portion was developed (or trained) and improved. 

-*Why?* Throughout justify development decisions. Address your algorithm(s) as a  good choice, why your training process was appropriate, etc.  

(task2d:accuracy)=
## Accuracy Analysis

In this section, discuss how you assessed the accuracy or success of the ML application(s). In most cases, this means providing an appropriate *metric* for assessing accuracy OR providing a development plan for obtaining such a metric in the future.
