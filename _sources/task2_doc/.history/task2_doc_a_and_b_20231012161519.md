# Task 2 parts A and B

The purpose of parts A and B is to demonstrate competency in communicating your technical solution to different less technical audiences. Follow the [Task 2 Template (new)](https://westerngovernorsuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/jim_ashe_wgu_edu/EWqB1zvgCDVMjsSivPMmFzYB4oUX-bj8Y5r4MjZt7f9xlQ?e=3F6xr2)

- Part A - Convince senior leadership to approve your project.
- Part B - Implementation plan for IT leadership (but not CS experts) or middle management.

Part D, explains the CS-related aspects of your project and (with the exception of the [User Guide](task2d:userguide)) should target the computer science subject matter experts. This is *not* a business project, and neither does the rubric have any qualitative business criteria for parts A and B. As such, parts A and B aspects such as budgets, methodology, and planning parts are not assessed rigorously from a business perspective.

## Part A: Letter of Transmittal

Write a letter convinving senior leadership to approve your project. Write ab rief cover letter (suggested length 1-2 pages) describing the problem, how the application (part C) applies to the problem, the practical benefits to the organization, and a brief implementation plan. Include all artifacts typical of a professional (business) letter, e.g., subject line, date, greeting, signature, etc. 

 

The letter should be concise and target a non-technical audience. Include the following: 

Summary of the problem. 

Recommendation for a solution centering around your application. 

How the proposed solution benefits the organization. 

A Summary of the costs, timeline, data, and any ethical concerns (if relevant). 

Your relevant expertise. 


Throughout part A:

- Target the non-technical senior leadership of the organization.

- Write everything in the future tense.

All page-length recommendations are *only suggestions*. There is no minimum page requirement, and the rubric only specifies that provided details be complete and logical. The proper content depth depends on your project.

### Letter of Transmittal

- Summarize the problem.

- Recommend a solution centered around your application.

- Describe how the proposed solution benefits the organization.

- Estimate of the total dollar cost (this should match the value given in [Funding Requirements](task2:parta:funding) of part A).

- Describe the expertise and experience which qualify you to develop the solution.  

- Include all artifacts typical of a professional (business) letter, e.g., subject line, date, greeting, signature, etc. (see [task 2 examples](resources:examples))

This page is still in development, and that's all I have for this page for now. However, you probably don't need much advice on these sections. There are few qualitative criteria by which these sections can be assessed. If the items in the template are addressed these sections are very rarely sent back.
